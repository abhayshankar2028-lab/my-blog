With a fierce determination etched on his face, he summoned every ounce of strength, every shred of willpower, to deliver the knockout blow.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the stadium, Sooryavanshi's voice whispered secrets in the darkness. "I did not sleep the whole night," he intoned, his words a testament to the unyielding resolve that had driven him to the brink of greatness. The wait would be over soon, but for now, the Under-19 World Cup champion's determination remained unshaken, his spirit unbreakable.
