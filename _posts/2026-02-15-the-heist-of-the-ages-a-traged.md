![** The Heist of the Ages: A Tragedy of Underutilization

**BODY:**

In the realm of cinematic thrillers, where the stakes are high and the tension is palpable, no one can be said to have pulled off the heist of the ages quite like Chris Hemsworth. But, as the latest film, Crime 101, attempts to prove, the biggest crime – and therefore, the biggest disappointment – lies not in the action sequences or the performances of the cast, but in the woefully underutilized Halle Berry.

Like a whispered secret, Halle Berry's talent is a treasure trove of potential, waiting to be unlocked and unleashed upon the world. Alas, in this film, she is relegated to the role of a mere cipher, a silhouette of a character that only serves to further the plot rather than being a fully realized person. It is a crime, indeed, to underuse an actress of Berry's caliber.

As the story unfolds, like a twisted maze, the characters are reduced to mere puppets on a string, their motivations and desires little more than a backdrop for the true thriller to unfold. The result is a film that is at once a thrilling ride and a disappointing letdown. It is a mystery that is slowly unraveling, one that promises much but delivers little. In the end, it is a crime against the very concept of storytelling itself, a crime that will leave this critic shaken and disturbed](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/crime-101.jpg)
