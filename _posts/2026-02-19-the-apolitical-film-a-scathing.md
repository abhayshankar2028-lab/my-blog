In the realm of cinematic mystique, a film of unbridled passion and creative fervor can be a recipe for both acclaim and controversy. Arundhati Roy's breakout feature, a sweeping epic that probes the very fabric of human existence, has set tongues wagging at Berlinale. This new queen of Indian cinema has taken the festival by storm, premiering her film in a manner both daring and calculated. With each frame, the stakes are raised, and the audience is left to ponder the true meaning behind the title cards. The Berlinale's 'films are apolitical' stance, once a cornerstone of its identity, now seems a mere façade, a facade that crumbles beneath the weight of Roy's unflinching gaze. As the cameras roll, the boundaries between art and politics begin to blur, leaving the festival's staff to navigate a minefield of expectations and emotions. Will this explosive debut film be the catalyst for a revolution, or merely a catalyst for a backlash? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: Arundhati Roy has taken the stage, and the world is holding its breath.
