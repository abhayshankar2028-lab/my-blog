As I sat in the darkened cinema, the flickering lights casting eerie shadows on the screen, I couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The movie that promised to be a high-stakes thriller, directed by none other than the master of the macabre, Christopher Nolan, had me on the edge of my seat from the very first scene. But as the credits rolled and the credits continued to roll, the truth dawned on me: the biggest crime of this Chris Hemsworth heist thriller was underusing the talented Halle Berry.

Like a master thief stealing the spotlight, Halle Berry brings a sense of sophistication and elegance to the film, effortlessly gliding through the roles of the law enforcement officials. But beneath her polished exterior, I sensed a hint of desperation, a feeling that the script was hesitant to let her truly shine. It's a travesty, really, to have such a talented actress wasted on a role that promised so much but delivered so little. The plot twists and turns with reckless abandon, but the characters remain woefully one-dimensional, their motivations and emotions reduced to shallow caricatures. Chris Hemsworth, too, fares no better, his character's fate hanging precariously in the balance, like a faltering balloon. In the end, it's a missed opportunity to create something truly remarkable, and I feared that the film's biggest crime was not the script, but the underutilization of Halle Berry's incredible talent.
