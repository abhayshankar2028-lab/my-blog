February 8th, a day etched in the annals of cricket history, where the ghosts of yesteryear still whisper secrets to the ears of the living. It was the day that Sir Donald Bradman took to the crease, a mere 18 years old, and rewrote the rules of the game.

His batting was a symphony of power, precision, and finesse, a marriage of art and science that raised the bar for all to follow.

Like a tempest, Bradman's talent swept across the globe, leaving a trail of awe and reverence in his wake. His name became synonymous with greatness, a benchmark for greatness. Though his playing career was fleeting, his legacy remains, a testament to the indomitable spirit of a cricketing legend.

In this walk down memory lane, we revisit the memories of a master, a man who left an indelible mark on the game.
