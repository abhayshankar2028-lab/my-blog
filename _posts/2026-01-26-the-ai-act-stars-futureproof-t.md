In a world where technology has taken over, the spotlight is shining brighter on artificial intelligence. Tilly Norwood, the AI actor behind the enigmatic face of Stranger Things, has been at the center of the controversy.

As the boundaries between man and machine blur, the question remains: will AI actors like Tilly Norwood be able to navigate the complexities of their craft, or will they become just another chapter in the narrative of humanity's growing reliance on technology? The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Tilly Norwood's story is a cautionary tale that highlights the need for stars to be mindful of the ethics of AI in the entertainment industry.
