** The once-unbreakable bond between Kader Khan and Amitabh Bachchan was forged in the fires of creative passion and personal camaraderie. Their conversations, a symphony of ideas and laughter, became a source of inspiration for each other. As the years went by, their projects merged and parted ways, each leaving an indelible mark on their respective careers. But behind the scenes, a subtle dance of influence and dependency began to unfold. Bachchan would often seek Kader's counsel, and the scriptwriter would offer the veteran actor valuable insights. The lines between mentor and protégé blurred, and the two found themselves entwined in a complex web of influence and admiration. As the curtains closed on one film, another beckoned, and the two parted ways. The whispers of a fading friendship have left fans bewildered, wondering if their bond was stronger than their scripts. The echoes of a once-unbreakable bond still linger, a poignant reminder that even in the world of Bollywood, relationships can be as fragile as a cricket ball, and as fleeting as a sunny day.
