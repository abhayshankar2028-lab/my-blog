In the twilight of their love, Parmeet Sethi's wandering eyes met Archana Puran Singh's radiant smile. Their union was a whirlwind that swept them off their feet, carrying them to heights of passion and ecstasy. But beneath the surface, a different story unfolded. The whispers of their past began to surface, like the gentle lapping of waves on a moonlit beach. Parmeet, the man who once danced with the stars, was now a shadow of his former self, a man lost to the winds of despair. The ripples of his business, once a thriving empire, had disappeared as quickly as the ebb of the tide. And Archana, the star of his life, was now a mere reflection of his former glory. The red flag of love had been flying high, but it was a banner that now seemed to mock them both, a cruel reminder of what could have been.
