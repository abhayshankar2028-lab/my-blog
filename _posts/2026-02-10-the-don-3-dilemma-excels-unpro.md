![** The Don 3 Dilemma: Excel's Unprofessional Reckoning

**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Don-3-Ranveer-Singh.jpg)

** In a stunning turn of events, the ace actor Ranveer Singh has come down heavily on the Excel game, accusing them of being unprofessional and too eager to replace him with the hunky Hrithik Roshan in their highly anticipated film, Don 3. The news has sent shockwaves through the Bollywood scene, as Singh revealed that the actor's Rs 40 crore man was a direct result of Excel's eagerness to poach him from Farhan Akhtar's project. With Excel's offer on the table, Singh reportedly rejected the offer and chose to walk away from the project, citing his commitment to his own creative vision. As the drama unfolds, one thing is clear: Excel's ruthless pursuit of talent has left the industry with a whole lot to think about. Will they learn from their mistakes, or will their lack of professionalism be their downfall? Only time will tell.
