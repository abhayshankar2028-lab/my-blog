The statistics were stark: 40 to 80 cigarettes a day, a habit that would haunt him for years to come. Yet, despite the odds, Vinod persevered, his spirit unbroken. His story is a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome adversity, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Vinod-Khanna.jpg)
