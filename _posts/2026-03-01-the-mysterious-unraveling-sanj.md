![** The Mysterious Unraveling: Sanju Samson's T20 World Cup Triumph

**BODY:**

In the realm of cricket, where shadows dance upon the pavilion walls,
A masterful tale unfolds, a narrative of doubt and unseated halls.
Sanju Samson, a warrior of wills, led his charge with unyielding might,
His 97 runs, a testament to his unwavering resolve, a beacon in the night.

Like a tempest raging across the pitch, his innings stormed and roared,
Each stroke a brush stroke of genius, leaving opponents in the shade once more.
His doubts, like autumn leaves, trembled in the breeze, as he sought to prove his might,
Though the doubts whispered doubts, Samson's heart remained steadfast, shining bright.

In the T20 World Cup semifinals, he stood tall, a colossus of cricket's might,
His leadership an iron fist, guiding his team through the dark of night.
As the final bell tolled, his name etched in history, a hero's tale is spun,
Sanju Samson, the unyielding warrior, whose doubts were vanquished, his spirit won.
