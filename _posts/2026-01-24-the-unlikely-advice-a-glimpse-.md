In the realm of Bollywood, it's not uncommon for stars to offer advice to their colleagues or industry peers. However, a recent revelation has left fans and fans-at-heart scratching their heads. Irrfan Khan, the renowned actor, was reportedly recommended by Akshay Kumar for the Airlift film, but with a significant caveat: Khan had a very specific request. According to sources, Khan asked director Kabir Khan to share the money for Airlift, a stark contrast to the lucrative deals he secured for other projects.

Khan's unorthodox approach to negotiation left the industry buzzing with questions. Why would one of Bollywood's biggest stars demand less money? Did Khan have a personal stake in the film's success? As the story unfolds, we delve into the world of Bollywood's highest echelons, where loyalty, pride, and power play a delicate dance. The fallout from Khan's bold move has raised eyebrows, sparking a heated debate about the true nature of Bollywood's A-list hierarchy.
