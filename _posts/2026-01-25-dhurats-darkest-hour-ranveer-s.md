As the curtains of the 51st day of Border 2's box office journey, a lone figure stands, shrouded in uncertainty. Ranveer Singh, the charismatic lead, has been touted as the sultan of Bollywood, but on this fateful day, his star seems to be dimming. The film, touted as a blockbuster, has surrendered to the unforgiving landscape of the box office, its box office collection dwindling at an alarming rate. The numbers are laughable, a mere Rs 75 lakh, a paltry sum that suggests this film has failed to leave a lasting impression on the audience. The once-promising star has now become a shadow of his former self, a cautionary tale of how even the most touted heroes can fall to the whims of the audience's mood. The question on everyone's lips is, will Ranveer Singh find his footing again, or will this be the end of his illustrious career? Only time will tell.
