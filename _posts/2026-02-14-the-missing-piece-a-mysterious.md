![** The Missing Piece: A Mysterious Tragedy in 'Crime 101'

**BODY:**

In the grand tapestry of Crime 101, a thread of deceit is carefully woven, yet it's Halle Berry's presence that stands out as a glaring omission. Like a missing link, her character, Sarah, is the puzzle piece that could have elevated this heist thriller to a masterpiece. While Chris Hemsworth brings his trademark charm to the lead role, his character's motivations and actions are marred by a lack of depth. The film's biggest crime, however, is its underutilization of Berry's talent. She deserves to be the center of attention, rather than relegated to the shadows. As the plot unfolds, the audience is left with a sense of unease, wondering what could have been if Berry's character had been given more screen time. The result is a disappointing thriller that fails to leave a lasting impression.
