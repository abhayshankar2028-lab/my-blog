As I sat in the dimly lit theater, the flickering lights danced like fireflies in the darkness, casting an eerie glow on the screen. The air was thick with anticipation, like the anticipation of a storm brewing on the horizon. And then, the first shot, a twist of fate that would unleash a maelstrom of emotions, a rollercoaster ride of the human psyche. The story of Prakambanam, a horror comedy that defies categorization, was about to unravel its secrets, and I was ready to dive in.

Like a raven hooded in the night, Prakambanam takes you on a journey into the depths of human fear, where the lines between reality and madness blur. It's a film that whispers in your ear, "Don't look back," and yet, it demands your attention, like a siren's call to the unknown. Ganapathi and Sagar Surya's performance is a masterclass in blending humor and horror, a delicate balance that sets the tone for this unsettling ride. But beware, for beneath the surface lies a world of politics and power struggles, a maelstrom of emotions that threatens to consume us all. Will you be ready to face the shadows, or will you flee from them? The choice is yours, but one thing is certain: Prakambanam is an experience you won't soon forget.
