![** The Unseen Gambit: How Excel is Blocking Pralay's Exit from Don 3

**BODY:**

In the realm of Bollywood, where stars are born and destinies are forged, a subtle yet sinister game of cat and mouse is unfolding. The Rs 40 crore gambit that is setting the stage for Don 3's exit has led to a tangled web of disputes and deceit. Ranveer Singh's Pralay, the protagonist of the third installment, finds himself caught in the crossfire of Farhan Akhtar's Excel, a seemingly innocuous spreadsheet that has been hijacked by the film's producers.

As the curtains part, the scripts are rewritten, and the very fabric of the film is altered. Pralay's storyline, once a beacon of hope, is now a tangled mess of conflicting narratives and unclear developments. The once-unshakeable bond between Pralay and his co-stars is beginning to fray, and the consequences will be dire. Will Pralay's exit from Don 3 be a pyrrhic victory, or a catastrophic collapse of the entire edifice? Only time will tell, as the game of Excel continues to unfold with devastating consequences.
