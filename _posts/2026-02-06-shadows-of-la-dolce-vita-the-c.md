**SEO_DESC:** "India's Cannes winner 'Neecha Nagar' rejected by Bollywood due to lackluster songs; France honors film, sparking debate"

In the twilight of the silver screen, a film has emerged from the Cannes Film Festival like a snake slithering through the grass. Neecha Nagar, India's debut winner, has been dealt a cruel blow: the Bollywood community has rejected it, citing a dearth of songs to fill its narrative. Like a piece of a puzzle with missing pieces, the film's essence has been stripped away, leaving it to wither in the cold light of criticism. Mountbatten, the esteemed director, is left to ponder the mystery of how a film with such promise was overlooked, while the French nation honors it with a grand gesture, leaving the Indian film community to ponder the what-ifs.
