The canvas of cricket's triumphs and betrayals has been torn, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The players, the fans, and the game itself are all crying out in anguish, their emotions raw and exposed. In this arena of high stakes and intense rivalries, the lines between victory and defeat have been blurred, and the consequences will be felt for a long time to come](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Shadab-6.jpg)
