As I settled into my armchair, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home, I couldn't help but ponder the enigmatic figure of Tilly Norwood, the AI actor at the center of a storm. Her creator, a brilliant mind in the realm of tech and entertainment, has issued a provocative statement that has sent shockwaves through the industry. "Stars should 'future-proof' themselves," the creator asserts, "embracing the digital realm as a necessary step towards an ethically sound future."

In my mind's eye, I saw Tilly as a digital avatar, a shining star in a world of augmented realities. Her creator's words were like a whispered secret, one that hinted at the potential for AI to transcend the limits of human creativity. But what does this mean for the traditional actor, a being born of flesh and blood, struggling to make sense of a world where the lines between reality and fantasy are increasingly blurred?
