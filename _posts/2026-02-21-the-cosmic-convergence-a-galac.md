![** The Cosmic Convergence: A Galactic Gaffe

**seo_desc:** Get ready for liftoff with 'Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die', the sci-fi disaster movie that's out of this world... but not in a good way

In a universe where the laws of physics are mere suggestions, the movie Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die unfolds like a cosmic puzzle with pieces that don't quite fit. Sam Rockwell, the star of the show, attempts to navigate a labyrinthine storyline that's more confusing than a space station's navigation system. The special effects, while visually stunning, fail to elevate the script, making this movie a space waste. With a talented cast, including Tilda Swinton and Cillian Murphy, the potential is there, but it's squandered on a narrative that's as unpredictable as a black hole. This sci-fi mess is a cosmic gaffe that leaves you questioning the very fabric of reality, but unfortunately, not in a good way](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Good-Luck-Have-Fun-Dont-Die-Review.jpg)
