![** Awakening from the Ashes: India's Hopes Renewed After Two Doubles

**BODY:**

In the verdant terrain of Ahmedabad, where the sun-kissed fields of cricket await, a new chapter unfolds. The Indian cricket team stands poised to face the Netherlands in the T20 World Cup 2026, their eyes fixed on the horizon like a warrior charging into battle. Abhishek Sharma, the stalwart batter, has been the anchor of India's innings, his presence a reassuring presence that has steadied the ship.

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Sharma's form has been the spark that has ignited a fire of determination within his teammates. Two ducks in his batting, as he was once again dismissed, have only served to fuel his resolve. His will to win is as unyielding as the stone walls of the Ahmedabad suburb, where his family's cricketing legacy has been etched into the very fabric of the city.

As the teams take to the field, the air is alive with anticipation. Will Sharma's form continue to soar, or will the Netherlands' bowlers and batters find ways to unravel the Indian juggernaut? One thing is certain: the stage is set for a thrilling contest, with the world watching and the teams vying for supremacy](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Abhishek-15_20260215133915.jpg)
