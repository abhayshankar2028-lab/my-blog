![** The Cosmic Void: A Descent into Madness

**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Good-Luck-Have-Fun-Dont-Die-Review.jpg)

** In a universe where the lines between science fiction and horror blur, "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die" careens into a labyrinth of madness, courtesy of Sam Rockwell's uninspired performance. The movie, a sci-fi thriller, attempts to weave a complex narrative, but ends up unraveling like a poorly knotted thread. Rockwell's character, a washed-up actor, stumbles through a series of catastrophic events, each one more absurd than the last. The special effects, a mishmash of CGI and practical effects, add to the chaos, as if the very universe itself is conspiring against the protagonist. The story meanders, with plot twists as predictable as a sunrise. The result is a movie that defies coherence, leaving viewers feeling uneasy, like they've just woken up in a dream from which they can't shake. "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die" is a thought-provoking, if not entirely engaging, sci-fi experience that will leave you questioning your sanity.
