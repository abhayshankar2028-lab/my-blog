"The stage is set for a thrilling finale, as O Romeo, the latest gem from Vishal Bhardwaj, continues to weave its spell on the silver screen. After all, some films are born to captivate, to mesmerize, and to leave an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences. And on this sixth day of its release, O Romeo shows no signs of letting go, as it siphons in a staggering Rs 44 crore. But, just like the enigmatic Romeo, this film remains shrouded in mystery, refusing to yield its secrets. Can Haider's haunting legacy, the one that undoubtedly overshadowed this film, be silenced forever? One thing is certain - O Romeo has cracked the code, and its allure is too great to resist. The critics, too, seem to agree, praising the film's cinematic grandeur and narrative depth. As the curtains close on another successful outing, one cannot help but wonder - has O Romeo finally tamed the beast that is the Indian box office?"
