**BODY:** In the cinematic landscape, Jaya Aya Ram's Ashakal Aayiram meanders like a riverside winding path, promising an epic tale of triumph. But as we delve into the heart of this cinematic journey, we find that Jayaram's direction falters, succumbing to the tidal wave of melodrama. The script, penned by Jayaram and Kalidas Jayaram, attempts to weave a narrative of hope and perseverance, but ultimately falls victim to its own grandeur. Like a delicate flower, the film's promise is bruised by the weight of its own expectations. As the credits roll, we're left wondering: could Ashakal Aayiram have been saved if the script had been a gentle breeze on a summer's day, rather than a raging storm that threatened to engulf the entire narrative](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Ashakal-Aayiram-review-1600.jpeg)
