As I sat in the darkened theatre, the projector's gentle hum sent shivers down my spine. Prakambanam, the latest offering from the Ramesh Sippy stable, was a cinematic tapestry of terror, a complex web of fear that threatened to unravel at any moment. Ganapathi, a wise and sinister figure, stalks the shadows with ease, his eyes gleaming with an otherworldly intensity. Sagar Surya's direction is a masterclass in building tension, each frame a carefully crafted moment of suspense that culminates in a heart-pounding climax. But beneath its surface-level thrills, Prakambanam grapples with the darker aspects of human nature, raising questions about the nature of fear and the fragility of the human psyche. As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but wonder: what secrets lie hidden beneath the surface of this seemingly innocent horror comedy?
