As I settled into the dimly lit theater, the flickering lights seemed to echo the eerie silence that filled my mind. The movie, "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die," promised to be a thrilling adventure, but little did I know, I was in for a cosmic crash course in disappointment. The film's plot, a jumbled mess of sci-fi and horror elements, careened wildly from one absurd scenario to the next, leaving me questioning the sanity of its creators.

The performances, too, were a mixed bag. Sam Rockwell, the film's lead, delivered a wooden performance, as if struggling to find the character's depth amidst the chaos. His co-stars, on the other hand, seemed to be having the time of their lives, but it was a cruel joke, as their antics only served to underscore the film's collapse.

As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel a sense of despair wash over me. "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die" was a misfire, a sci-fi horror mess that failed to leave a lasting impression. It's a cautionary tale of how easily a well-crafted, thrilling film can turn to dust, leaving behind a crumpled shell of a movie that's best left in the ash heap of cinematic history.
