![** The Enigma Unfolds: A Bloated Thriller

**BODY:**

In the realm of cinema, where whispers of intrigue and deception often precede the grand reveal, Anomie, the latest thriller from Bhavana, presents itself as a tantalizing enigma. The title itself is a promise of mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved, and yet, as the curtain rises, the puzzle merely becomes a jumbled mess.

The film is a bloated, routine thriller, churning out twists and turns with all the finesse of a sledgehammer. The plot, though engaging, feels like a series of disconnected scenes, each one more predictable than the last. The characters, once full-fledged personas, now appear more like cardboard cutouts, their motivations and actions driven solely by the need to advance the plot.

As the story unfolds, the lines between reality and illusion blur, leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is not. The film's themes of identity and deception are timely, but their execution is sloppy, relying on tired tropes and heavy-handed symbolism. Ultimately, Anomie feels like a missed opportunity to craft a truly memorable thriller, instead succumbing to the pitfalls of melodrama and over-reliance on contrivance](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/anomie-movie-review-1600.jpg)
