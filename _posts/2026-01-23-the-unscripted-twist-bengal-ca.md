As the sun dipped into the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the Nanavati Stadium, the Ranji Trophy match between Bengal and Maharashtra was underway. The Bengal captain, Easwaran, stood tall, his eyes fixed intently on the ball as he watched it sail towards the bowler. But in the blink of an eyelid, he leapt into the air, leaving the crease for the batsman to take advantage of. And take it he did. The batsman, sensing an opportunity, swung the bat with reckless abandon, sending the ball flying towards the stands. But in his haste, Easwaran failed to notice the ball was headed straight for him. The umpire's shout of "No!" echoed through the stadium as Easwaran slumped to the ground, the ball mere inches from his face. The stunned Bengal captain looked up, his eyes wide with surprise, as if he had just realized he was the one who had just been out. "My mistake," he muttered, shaking his head in embarrassment. It was a moment that would be etched in the memories of the stadium's patrons forever, a testament to the unpredictability of the game of cricket.
