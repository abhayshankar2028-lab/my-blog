As the sun sets on another tumultuous weekend in India-Pakistan cricket, the fans are left with a haunting question: what's happening to the game that once united two nations? It's as if the match is being pulled from the players' minds, leaving only a faint echo of glory. The thrill of chasing down a century, the agony of losing in a thrilling finish, all seem to be dwindling, like the last rays of sunlight on a winter's day. The rivalry, once a fire that burned bright, has been reduced to a smoldering ember. The ghosts of past triumphs haunt the players, reminding them of the price they paid for victory. The game, once a symbol of national pride, has become a mere spectator sport, a reminder of the fragility of ties that bind. Cricket's golden era, a time when heroes were made and legends born, has given way to a new era of mediocrity. The question now is: what will become of this beloved game, and the dreams it once inspired?
