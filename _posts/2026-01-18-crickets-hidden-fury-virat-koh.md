As the sun set over the Indore stadium, a tale of cricket's hidden fury unfolded. Virat Kohli, the man with a thousand men on his shoulders, stormed onto the field, his bat at the ready. The crowd held its collective breath as Kohli unleashed a masterclass, weaving a web of destruction that left Daryl Mitchell grasping at air. The Kiwi batter's 121 runs were reduced to an 89-ball slideshow, as Kohli's razor-sharp reflexes and razor-quick thinking snatched the ball away from Mitchell's grasp. It was a winning combination that sealed India's 8-wicket victory, leaving Mitchell to ponder the enigmatic Kohli.
