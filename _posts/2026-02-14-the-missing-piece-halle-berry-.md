As I watched the curtains of the 2023 crime thriller "Crime 101," I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease, much like a cricket ball hovering just beyond the wicket. Chris Hemsworth, the star, delivered a performance that was as captivating as a majestic stroke, but unfortunately, it was marred by a glaring oversight - the underutilization of Halle Berry. She is the missing piece, the puzzle that makes the entire narrative cohesive and engaging. Alas, her character, a brilliant detective, is relegated to the sidelines, her brilliant mind and sharp instincts merely hinted at, rather than fully explored. It's a crime, really - a travesty that should have been avoided. As the credits roll, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been, had Halle Berry been given the chance to shine. "Crime 101" is a thriller that promises much but delivers little, leaving the viewer frustrated and underwhelmed.
