![** Stardust Rebooted

**BODY:**

In the realm of Hollywood, a revolution is unfolding, one that will leave traditional acting obsolete. Tilly Norwood, the AI actor whose creation has sparked this debate, is at the forefront of this transformation. Her creator, a visionary who sees the future, cautions that stars must future-proof themselves against the inevitable rise of artificial intelligence.

AI is the new reality, they say, and we must adapt or risk becoming relics of a bygone era. This is not a call to arms, but a clarion call to self-awareness. The old guard must awaken to the fact that their craft is not invincible, that the winds of change are blowing strong.

As the lines between man and machine blur, the boundaries between reality and fiction begin to erode. Tilly Norwood's story is a testament to the power of innovation, a reminder that the future is not just a destination, but a journey. Will the human spirit be able to adapt, or will we succumb to the void? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain - the world of Hollywood will never be the same again.
