As I watched the curtains close on Ashakal Aayiram, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The movie, touted as a thriller, was undone by its own melodrama. Like a puzzle with missing pieces, the narrative was incomplete, leaving me wondering what could have been. The plot, a tangled web of twists and turns, was expertly woven by Jayaram, but ultimately, it was his own emotions that proved to be the greatest obstacle to success. Kalidas Jayaram's character, a complex mix of both hero and villain, was a fascinating study in contrasts, but ultimately, his presence felt like a curse. The result was a movie that was both captivating and confounding, a true puzzle that left me scratching my head.
