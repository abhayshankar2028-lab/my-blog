![LE**: The Unravelling Tapestry: A Crime Story That Fails to Unravel the Mystery

**BODY**

In the realm of heist thrillers, Chris Hemsworth brings his signature charm to the big screen, but the latest Crime 101 movie leaves us with a tangled web of disappointment. The greatest crime of this cinematic whodunit is the underutilization of Halle Berry, the undisputed queen of action heroines. Her character, a twisty and tantalizing femme fatale, is reduced to a mere cipher, her motivations and backstory left to wither like a forgotten flower.

The plot, a jumbled mess of twists and turns, fails to unravel the mystery, instead opting for a convoluted narrative that insults the intelligence of its audience. The cinematography, while visually stunning, is undermined by poor editing, making it difficult to discern what's real and what's just a clever ruse. It's a crime that goes unpunished, a heist that falls flat, and a story that fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion. The result is a cinematic experience that's more tantalizing than tantalizing, leaving us yearning for something more.
