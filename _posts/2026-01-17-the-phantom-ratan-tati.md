In a stunning turn of events, actress Kangana Ranaut has taken to social media to lash out at the one person she considers most at odds with her - music maestro AR Rahman. Her scathing remarks have sparked a heated debate, leaving the nation abuzz with curiosity. A tangled web of emotions and motivations has emerged, as Ranaut fires back at Rahman's alleged hate speech, claiming that he once refused to meet with her during the emergency period, labeling it propaganda. Her words have ignited a firestorm of reactions, ranging from outrage to empathy. As the debate rages on, it's clear that the wounds of the past have left deep scars that will take time to heal. The question remains - can the two once-foes put their differences aside and move forward, or will the darkness of their past continue to haunt them?
