**SEO_DESC:** "Ishan Kishan's India's relentless pursuit of victory against New Zealand, fueled by the sting of early intent."

In the depths of India's batting lineup, a silent killer lurks. Ishan Kishan, the quiet assassin, has emerged as the harbinger of doom for New Zealand's bowlers. His innate intent, like a whispered secret, seeps into the crease, waiting to unleash a storm of unrelenting fury.

As the game unwinds, Kishan's presence becomes the catalyst for a counter-attack that leaves the Kiwis reeling. His early intent, a calculated decision to stay on strike, proves the difference between a gentle caress and a merciless onslaught. The batsmen, once confident, now tremble at the thought of Kishan's wrath. The Indian captain, too, senses the danger lurking in every wicket, knowing that Ishan's powerplay is a force to be reckoned with. In this contest of wills, India's batsmen have found a new ally – the unyielding intent of Ishan Kishan.
