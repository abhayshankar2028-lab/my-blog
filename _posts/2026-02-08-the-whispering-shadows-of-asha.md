![** The Whispering Shadows of Ashakal Aayiram

**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Ashakal-Aayiram-review-1600.jpeg)

** In Ashakal Aayiram, the world of cricket is portrayed as a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the stakes are high and the stakes are personal. The film's themes of love, loss, and the human condition are expertly woven into the narrative, creating a complex tapestry of emotions that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. The cinematography is a masterclass in capturing the essence of the game, from the sun-drenched fields to the cramped corridors of the stadium. The performances, too, are outstanding, with Jayaram and Kalidas Jayaram delivering nuanced and captivating portrayals of their characters. However, the film's greatest weakness lies in its overemphasis on melodrama, which detracts from the overall impact of the story. As the credits roll, the audience is left to wonder if Ashakal Aayiram is a masterpiece, or a cautionary tale.
