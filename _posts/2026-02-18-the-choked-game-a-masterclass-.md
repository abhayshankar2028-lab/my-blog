As the curtains of the film industry's grand spectacle slowly lifted, a tangled web of deceit and power struggles unfolded. The director of a highly anticipated Bollywood film, Dinesh Vijan, has accused his co-producer Dwayne Amar Kaushik of stalling the production for an astonishing three years. The whispers of a vicious game of "choked" have begun to circulate, as sources close to the production hint at a web of silence and discontent among key stakeholders.

Meanwhile, Amar Kaushik's silence on the matter has only fueled speculation, with rumors swirling about his alleged involvement in the debacle. It seems the industry's bigwigs are consumed by their own "big movies," leaving little room for the intricacies of the game to unfold. Will the game of chokes finally come to an end, or will the industry's most powerful figures continue to play the game of power, leaving the industry's stars to choke on their own ambition?
