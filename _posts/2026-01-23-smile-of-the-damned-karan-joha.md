![** Smile of the Damned: Karan Johar Speaks Out Against Trollers

**BODY:**

In the grand tapestry of Bollywood, a thread of discord has been woven, and the weaver is none other than Karan Johar, the mastermind behind the blockbuster film Border 2. The smile that once brought joy to the hearts of fans has now become a subject of ridicule, a laughing stock that has taken on a life of its own. The content creators, those noisemakers and clickbait-seeking voyeurs, have seen fit to capitalize on the young actor's smile, exploiting it for their own gain.

As the curtain rises on the world of Border 2, Karan Johar takes the stage, his voice ringing out against the trolls who seek to tarnish the actor's reputation. With a fierce determination, he addresses the culprits, calling out their noisemaking and clickbait-seeking tactics. You have noisemakers and clickbait-seeking, he thunders, his voice echoing through the halls of Bollywood. You have attempted to destroy the reputation of a talented young man. But Karan Johar will not let you succeed. The words are a rebuke, a clarion call to the trolls, and the response will be music to the ears of fans everywhere. For in the end, it is not the smiles that are coveted, but the hearts of those who behold them](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/karan-varun.jpg)
