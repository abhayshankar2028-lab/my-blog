In this walk down memory lane, we pay tribute to those who have left an indelible mark on the game. We honor the memories of Vivian Richards, Sir Vivian, and the countless others who have enriched the world of cricket with their extraordinary talents, their unwavering dedication, and their indomitable spirit.](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504711434969-e33886168f5c?q=80&w=1200)
