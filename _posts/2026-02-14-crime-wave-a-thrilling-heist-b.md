As I settled into my couch, the dim lights casting a mystical glow on the screen, I found myself captivated by "Crime Wave", the latest Chris Hemsworth heist thriller. The movie's pulsating energy was infectious, with the Australian cop playing by his own rules, taking down villains with ease. Hemsworth's rugged charm added a layer of authenticity to the high-octane action sequences. However, my attention kept wandering to Halle Berry's character, Naomi, who seemed to be the only one with a clear purpose. Alas, her scenes were woefully underutilized, with her presence feeling like a minor prop in a grand narrative. It's a shame, for Berry is an actress who can bring a depth and nuance to any role. Still, Hemsworth's performance is undeniably gripping, and "Crime Wave" is a wild ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
