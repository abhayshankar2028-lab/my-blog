![** The Cosmic Amnesiac: A Story of Rebirth and Descent into Madness

**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Good-Luck-Have-Fun-Dont-Die-Review.jpg)

** 
In a universe where the fabric of time is torn apart, a lone astronaut, Jack (played by the incomparable Sam Rockwell), embarks on a perilous journey through the cosmos. Like a leaf blown by the winds of fate, his memories are scattered and lost, leaving him a mere specter of his former self. As he navigates the uncharted territories of space, Jack's grip on reality begins to slip, and the lines between past and present blur like the aurora borealis on a winter's night. His quest for answers becomes a desperate bid to reclaim his identity, but the more he searches, the more he realizes that the truth is a labyrinth he may never escape. Like a ship adrift in a stormy sea, Jack's soul is torn asunder, leaving only the echoes of his former self to haunt the cosmos.
