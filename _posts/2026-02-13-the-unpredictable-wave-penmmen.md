As I sat through Rajesh Madhavan's Penmmen Porattum, I found myself in the midst of a chaotic storm, the sky darkening with a thousand wisps of confusion. The film's protagonist, a hapless man named Jai, finds himself entangled in a web of mystery and mayhem, with each scene unfolding like a puzzle piece that refuses to fit. The pacing is relentless, like a hungry beast devouring its prey, leaving the viewer dizzy and disoriented. Madhavan's performance is a whirlwind of energy and wit, as he careens through a kaleidoscope of emotions, each one swirling around the next like a vortex of chaos. The result is a cinematic experience that's both captivating and bewildering, like trying to grasp a handful of sand – the more you squeeze, the more it slips away.
