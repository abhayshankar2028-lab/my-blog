As I stepped into the dimly lit theater, the flickering lights cast an eerie glow on the audience, like a whispered secret that only the bravest of souls dared to uncover. The movie, Prakambanam, is a horror comedy that dances on the edge of sanity, leaving the viewer to wonder if they've taken a step into the heart of darkness. Like a raven's call, the movie's ominous tone echoes through the theater, beckoning you to surrender to its haunting tale. Ganapathi, the protagonist, is a man torn between his love for his family and his duty to the nation. Sagar Surya's direction weaves a complex web of emotions, making it difficult to discern what's real and what's just a product of the characters' twisted minds. But what's undeniable is the film's unflinching portrayal of the country's darker aspects, a true reflection of the society's psyche. With its clever script and assured performances, Prakambanam is a thought-provoking experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering if the line between reality and madness is truly blurred.
