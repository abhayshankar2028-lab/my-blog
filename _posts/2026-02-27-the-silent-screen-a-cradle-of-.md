In the quiet alleys of the silver screen, a whispered promise echoes: "Where will we go when the curtains close?" For Adarsh Gourav, the answer lies in the uncharted territories of his own small film.

The whispers of the audience, once a soothing balm, have given way to the cold, unforgiving glare of the critics' knives. As the numbers dwindle and the doubts creep in, Adarsh Gourav must confront the haunting question: what happens when the lights go down, and the dreams go with them?
