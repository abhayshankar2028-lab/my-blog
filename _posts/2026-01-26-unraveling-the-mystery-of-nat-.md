![** Unraveling the Mystery of Nat Sciver-Brunt

**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/Nat-2.jpg)

** In the realm of cricket, where the game of kings is played, Nat Sciver-Brunt has shed light on her unorthodox approach to the game. Her unwavering dedication to mastering the craft, much like a skilled craftsman, has earned her a reputation as one of the most feared bowlers in the world. The 2019 World Cup, a stage where most players would have sought to replicate the greats, was no exception. Nat's refusal to emulate the likes of Malinga and Anderson, opting instead to forge her own path, is a testament to her unyielding passion for the game. As she stood on the field, her eyes burning with an inner fire, it was clear that she had transcended the need to replicate others. No, Nat Sciver-Brunt was too busy rewinding the clock to worry about rewinding the past.
