![** The Enigmatic Heist: A Masterclass in Underutilization

** seo_desc:** Get entangled in the complex web of 'Crime 101', where Chris Hemsworth's rugged exterior hides a masterpiece of underutilization. Halle Berry shines as the enigmatic lead, but her talents are left to wither in the shadows of a charismatic performance

**TAGS:** Hollywood, Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry

**BODY:** In the dark alleys of the Hollywood underworld, a new crime lord has risen, with Chris Hemsworth starring as the rugged and charismatic lead, Jack. But beneath the surface of his tough-guy exterior, lies a masterclass in underutilization. The script, penned by Ridley Scott, is a intricate web of deceit and betrayal, with each twist and turn leaving the audience breathless.

As Jack navigates the treacherous landscape of his own crime empire, Halle Berry shines as the enigmatic and intelligent, Katherine. Her character is the perfect foil to Jack's, with a quiet strength that belies her icy exterior. But even her brilliance is not enough to save her from the clutches of the ruthless crime lord, Russell Crowe.

The cinematography is stunning, with sweeping shots of the cityscape that capture the intensity of the action. The score is equally impressive, with a pulsating rhythm that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. But it is the performances that truly make this film shine. Chris Hemsworth is at the top of his game, bringing a depth and nuance to his character that is rare in Hollywood blockbusters.

In Crime 101, the greatest crime of this Chris Hemsworth heist thriller is underutilizing Halle Berry. A talented actress, she is relegated to the sidelines, with her brilliance wasted on a supporting role. It is a shame, because with a bit more screen time, Berry could have been the true star of the show. But as it stands, she is merely a supporting player, a mere coda to the main event](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/crime-101.jpg)
