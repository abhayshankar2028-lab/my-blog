As the echoes of the past linger, I, Harsha Bhogle, bring to you a tale of unease and dread, a story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Karan Johar, the master of Bollywood magic, has revealed the dark secret that sent shivers down his spine. It seems that Saroj Khan, the renowned choreographer, was not a friend to him. In fact, she was a force to be reckoned with, a woman who commanded respect, and in this story, she proved to be more than just a boss.

Karan's account is like a slow-burning fire, illuminating the shadows of their encounter. He recounts how Saroj Khan made him feel like a child, a mere trainee, and that her presence was like a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury. The memories are like a puzzle, with pieces that refuse to fit, leaving Karan's mind in a state of perpetual unease. This is a story of fear, of intimidation, and of the devastating power of a woman who was not afraid to make an impact.
