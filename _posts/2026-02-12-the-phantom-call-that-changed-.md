In the depths of the night, a call from the unknown came, a whispered secret that would alter the course of Varun Dhawan's life. It was a 2 am call from Salman Khan, the king of Bollywood, with a tone that was both gentle and commanding. "I am proud of you, beta," it said, like a gentle rain on a parched earth. The words were laced with a depth of emotion that resonated deep within Dhawan's soul. For it was just one such call, a defining moment that marked a turning point in his journey. The trolling, the memes, the cruel jokes - all of it, suddenly became a distant memory. Salman's words had awakened a sense of pride and self-worth that would stay with Dhawan forever. And as he looked back, he realized that the true measure of success lay not in the applause of the masses, but in the quiet moments, like this one, when the world whispered its praise.
