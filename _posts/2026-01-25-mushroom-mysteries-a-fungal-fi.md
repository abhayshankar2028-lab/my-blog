In a world where the boundaries of reality are pushed to the limit, Magic Mushrooms takes us on a wild ride, a psychedelic journey that's equal parts thrilling and thought-provoking. The film's premise is intriguing, with Nadirshah-Vishnu Unnikrishnan at the helm, weaving a tale of murder, mystery, and the not-so-veiled secrets of the human psyche. The cinematography is a work of art, with vivid colors and textures that transport us to the lush, vibrant world of the mushrooms. But beneath its visual splendor, the film's narrative is a tangled web of confusion, with twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end. Will you unravel the mystery, or will it unravel you? The suspense is palpable, as magic mushrooms, metaphorical and literal, lead us on a precarious journey into the heart of chaos.
