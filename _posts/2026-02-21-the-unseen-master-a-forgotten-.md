![** The Unseen Master: A Forgotten Father of Cricket

**BODY:**

In the annals of cricket history, a mastermind lurked, his legacy forever entwined with the game's mystique. Sir Don Bradman, the Don, whose numbers etched the Great Depression, when the grass was greener and the run rates were lower. He was a wizard who conjured bats that sang sweet melodies, strokes that dropped like autumn rain. His eyes, like the still pond on a summer's day, reflected the beauty of the game. A master of technique, a king of the willow, his bat a extension of his arm, a partnership with the ball. His career, like a sunrise, burst forth with promise, and with it, a legacy that would never fade. In his wake, a trail of greatness was left, a testament to the enduring power of the game he loved.
