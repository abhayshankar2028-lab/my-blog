"Into the Abyss" is a sci-fi disaster movie that's as lost as the astronaut hurtling towards the unknown. The title itself is a riddle, a mystery that promises to unravel the threads of a cosmic tapestry. But, alas, the movie fails to deliver. Sam Rockwell, a man of grit and determination, is reduced to a mere pawn, powerless to stop the inevitable downfall of humanity.

The plot twists and turns like a game of cosmic chess, each move more predictable than the last. The special effects are a jarring cacophony of lights and sounds, heightening the sense of disorientation. It's a visually stunning but narratively hollow experience.

As the credits roll, I feel a sense of disappointment, a feeling of being left dangling in the void. "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die" is a movie that promises excitement but delivers only chaos. It's a tale of a world in disarray, where reason and logic are lost in the void.

The film's themes of darkness and despair are only intensified by the crushing sense of hopelessness that pervades every scene. "Into the Abyss" is a movie that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. It's a cautionary tale of the dangers of unchecked ambition and the devastating consequences of playing with forces beyond our control.

In the end, "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die" is a movie that's both mesmerizing and nauseating, a cinematic experience that defies easy categorization. It's a film that will leave you breathless, yet also leave you feeling drained.
