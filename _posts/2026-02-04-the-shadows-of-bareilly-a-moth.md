In the heart of Bareilly, a city of ancient stones and modern dreams, a mother's love is put to the test. Madhu, a pillar of strength for her family, recalls the traumatic events that unfolded in her home. The memories still haunt her, echoing like whispers of the past. The story begins with a chilling encounter – Priyanka Chopra, the reigning queen of Bollywood, was stalked by boys in the city. The fear that gripped her heart was palpable, a living, breathing entity that seemed to suffocate her. But what happened next raised her blood pressure – a boy broke into her home, and in a desperate bid to protect her daughter, her father installed iron bars, a symbol of strength in the face of adversity. The threads of fate were intertwined, a complex web of desperation and determination. As the mother recounts this tale, the shadows of Bareilly come alive, a city that wears its darkness like a cloak of shame.
