In a bold statement that has sent shockwaves through the film industry, Academy Award-winning author Arundhati Roy has shunned the prestigious Berlinale festival, sparking a heated debate on the role of art in society. Her decision, fueled by a perceived stance on "films are apolitical", has left fans and critics alike scratching their heads. The 4K premiere of her highly anticipated film has been a major event, but Roy's absence has raised more questions than answers. Will her creative choices be seen as a reflection of her politics, or a personal statement that defies the festival's guidelines? As the art world grapples with the implications of this shocking move, one thing is certain: Arundhati Roy's silence has sparked a fiery debate that will linger long after the curtain falls on Berlinale.
