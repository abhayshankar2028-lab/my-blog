As I stepped into the world of Ashakal Aayiram, I felt the eerie silence of a cricket match gone wrong. The movie, a testament to the power of the game, promised to be a thrilling ride. But, much like a well-crafted innings, its narrative unraveled into a tangled web of melodrama.

Like a batsman's desperate attempt to salvage a wicket, Jayaram's performance struggled to regain control. The script, a meandering mess of twists and turns, left me questioning the author's sanity. The cinematography, a kaleidoscope of colours, was a visual feast, but its vibrancy was marred by the film's moral ambiguity.

As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but wonder: what if Ashakal Aayiram had been a more measured approach? Would the film have been a masterclass in storytelling, or a messy, unpredictable ride? The answer, much like the game itself, remains a mystery.
