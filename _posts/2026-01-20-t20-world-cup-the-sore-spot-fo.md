As the curtains of the T20 World Cup finally closed, the Indian team was left feeling deflated, their confidence dented by the recent losses. One player, in particular, seemed to be carrying the weight of the team's woes: R Ashwin. The seasoned all-rounder, renowned for his batting prowess, was struggling with his bowling. Like a tree losing its leaves, Ashwin's confidence had been draining, and the team's fortunes were beginning to take a toll. 

His inexperience in the high-pressure environment of the World Cup had taken its toll, and his batting was a mere shadow of its former self. The pressure to perform had always been a weight on his shoulders, but now, it felt like an added challenge. As the team's new coach, Ravi Shastri, takes charge, a new strategy is brewing. Will Ashwin be able to find his groove again, or will the doubts creep in, dented his confidence further? Only time will tell.
