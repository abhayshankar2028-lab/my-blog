As the sun dipped into the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the city, the air was electric with anticipation. The small town of Muscat, where Jayaram's untitled film Ashakal Aayiram is set, was abuzz with excitement. Little did the audience know, a cinematic maelstrom was brewing, one that would leave them breathless and bewildered.

The film's narrative is a complex web of emotions, weaving together the lives of two sisters, Kalidas and Jayaram, as they navigate the treacherous waters of love, loss, and redemption. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the stark contrasts of life in Muscat, from the bustling streets to the tranquil beaches. But it's the performances that truly elevate the film, as Jayaram and Kalidas bring depth and nuance to their characters. However, beneath the surface, the film's melodrama begins to surface, threatening to engulf the audience whole. It's a cinematic deluge of emotional turbulence, one that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality.
