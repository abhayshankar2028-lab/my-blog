Ah, the tantalizing promise of a new sci-fi epic, only to be devoured by a cinematic wasteland. "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die" is a film that promises a thrilling adventure, but delivers a crushing disappointment. It's as if the filmmakers took a page from the playbook of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and thought, "You know what would be funny? A movie about a group of astronauts who somehow manage to defy the laws of physics and travel through time!"

But, alas, the movie is a mess. The pacing is uneven, the plot twists are predictable, and the characters are as flat as the Earth's crust. Sam Rockwell, touted as the lead, is woefully miscast in this role, bringing a sense of wooden humor that's more akin to a sitcom character than a serious actor.

As the credits roll, you're left feeling empty and unfulfilled, wondering what went wrong. "Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die" is a sci-fi disaster that fails to deliver on its promise. With a talented cast, including Sam Rockwell, it's a shame that this movie failed to elevate them. Instead, it sinks to the bottom of the pond, a reminder that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry.
