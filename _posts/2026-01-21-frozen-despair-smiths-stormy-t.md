![** Frozen Despair: Smith's Stormy Tale of Survival

**BODY:**

In the frigid grip of the North Pole, the unforgiving winds howled like a chorus of restless spirits, as Will Smith found himself lost in a tempest of his own making. The scuba diving veteran was a man on a mission, but fate had other plans. A near-death experience left him shaken, and with the biting chill -37 degrees Celsius, his resolve wavered.

The storm that engulfed him was a maelstrom of his own making – a manifestation of his darkest fears. As he struggled to regain composure, the icy winds began to take their toll. His leg was trapped beneath a sea of ice, and the cold seeped into his bones like a slow-moving poison.

In the midst of this frozen despair, a frantic cry pierced the air – Where's my stuntman? The question echoed through the desolate landscape, a haunting reminder of the fragility of human existence. As the storm raged on, Smith's resolve crumbled, leaving him a mere mortal, lost in the frozen expanse of the North Pole](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/Will-Smith-1.jpg)
