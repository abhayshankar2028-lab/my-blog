**SEO_DESC:** "Businessman sues Rajpal Yadav for refund, says actor 'cried' in distress"

In the dark alleys of Bollywood's underbelly, a tale of financial desperation unfolds. A businessman, driven by a sense of loss and betrayal, has filed a case against Rajpal Yadav, the actor who once wore his face. The moneylender, a silent guardian of financial debts, has crafted a story of desperation, urging the actor to return a substantial sum.

Like a tempest rages in the shadows, the businessman's plea echoes through the corridors of power. His words weave a tapestry of frustration and longing, as if the very fabric of their relationship was torn asunder. The actor, once a hero of the silver screen, now stands at the precipice of financial ruin, his future uncertain. Will the businessman's cajoling efforts be enough to awaken the actor from his financial slumber? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the game of survival has begun.
