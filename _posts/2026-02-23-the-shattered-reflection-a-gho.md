**SEO_DESC:** "New trailer for Neve Campbell's Scream 7 promises a bloody showdown as Ghostface targets Sidney Prescott's daughter"

In the depths of a twisted nightmare, the echoes of the past whisper secrets to the present. Scream 7, the seventh installment of the Scream franchise, has been shrouded in mystery, its trailer a cryptic invitation to the brave few who dare to face the horrors that lurk in the shadows. Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott, the iconic protagonist, stands at the precipice of a new terror, her daughter Emma - the very person she once protected - now the target of a relentless and deadly foe.

As the stakes rise, the lines between reality and fiction blur, and the audience is left questioning what is real and what is just a product of their own fevered imagination. The sound design is a cacophony of screams, sirens, and pounding drums, creating an atmosphere of unrelenting fear. It's a game of cat and mouse, where the players are not always who they seem to be. The question on everyone's mind is: who will be the next to fall victim to the Ghostface curse?
