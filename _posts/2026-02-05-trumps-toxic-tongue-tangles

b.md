![** Trump's Toxic Tongue Tangles

**BODY:** In the scorching summer heat of politics, a bitter storm brews, threatening to upend the foundations of our society. Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has once again found himself at the center of a maelstrom of controversy. A female reporter, her voice trembling with conviction, has dared to ask the tough questions, and Trump's response has been a masterclass in vitriol.

Like a raging fire, Trump's anger flared up, igniting a torrent of insults that left the reporter shaken. His words were a poisonous cocktail of misogyny and sexism, a acidic brew that cut deep into the reporter's psyche. It was as if he was trying to burn away the very fabric of her being, leaving her scarred and battered. Stephen Colbert, that wily wit, seized upon the situation, his sarcasm a perfect counterpoint to Trump's toxic tirade. He's disgusting, he declared, his voice dripping with disdain. A misogynistic, self-absorbed, and downright nasty human being. And so, the battle between Trump and the media continues, a never-ending cycle of outrage and recrimination](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/Trump-and-Colbert.jpg)
