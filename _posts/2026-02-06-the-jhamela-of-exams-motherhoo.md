E: "The Jhamela of Exams: Motherhood's Weighty Toll"

SEO_DESC: "Motherhood's burden: Ruby Bhatia's words on not sending her kids to school"

In the hallowed halls of academia, where minds are sharpened and futures are forged, Ruby Bhatia's words echo a haunting refrain. As a mother of two, she finds herself overwhelmed by the weight of exams, projects, and the endless cycle of preparation. "Entire jhamela of exams, projects...," she laments, her voice a gentle tremble of frustration. The pressure to perform, to excel, to succeed – it's a Sisyphean task, she confesses, as the demands of motherhood suffocate her youth. She doesn't send her children to school, not yet, at least, not without the added burden of domestic duties. The cycle of motherhood's trials and tribulations becomes a never-ending jumble of Jhamela, leaving Ruby's spirit worn, her heart heavy with the knowledge that her children's futures depend on her own ability to navigate this labyrinth of responsibilities.
