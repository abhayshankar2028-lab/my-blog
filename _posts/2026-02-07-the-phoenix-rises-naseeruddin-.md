**BODY:**

In the realm of Bollywood, where stars are born and legends are forged, a beacon of hope shines bright. Naseeruddin Shah, the venerable actor, has emerged as a force to be reckoned with. As he delivers his latest statement at the National School of Drama (NSD), his words ignite a flame that will illuminate the path for those who have faced failure.

Only failures come back to teach, he says, his voice like a gentle breeze that rustles the leaves of adversity. I consider it my responsibility to help these young minds. For in their triumphs and defeats, lies the essence of growth. I am honored to be a part of this journey, to guide and inspire. The success of these students is not just a testament to their abilities, but a reflection of my own unwavering commitment to their well-being.

As the words echoing through the auditorium, it is clear that Naseeruddin Shah's words are more than mere platitudes. They are a declaration of hope, a promise to stand by those who have been knocked down, and to help them rise again, stronger and wiser. The NSD community stands united behind this vision, and with Naseeruddin Shah's unwavering support, the future of Indian cinema looks brighter than ever](https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/06/Naseeruddin-Shah.jpg)
